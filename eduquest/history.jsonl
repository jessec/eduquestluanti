A few targeted fixes/clarifications will reduce risk.\n\n  ## Review / fixes\n\n  - Progress endpoint path\n      - Your spec uses POST /api/courses/{courseId}/progress (good). Keep it exactly that; it’s the same one used by the v2 player.\n  - currentIndex\n      - Do not assume order == currentIndex.\n      - In v2 progress, currentIndex is the player’s “position in visible items”, while order is an authoring sort key on items. They often align, but they don’t have to.\n      - For the Luanti game, safest is: send a monotonic local integer (0,1,2,…) representing “how many questions attempted in this session/course”, or just send 0 always if you don’t need resume behavior in the\n        game. The backend mainly cares about itemId + selectedAnswer.\n  - completed\n      - Treat completed as optional “course finished” state. If you can’t reliably compute it, send false always.\n      - Your current plan to compute completed=true when no unseen eligible items remain for that course is reasonable, but only if you scope selection per-course.\n  - Mixing courses\n      - Your new endpoint returns questions only from active courses and returns unanswered first, else wrong. It may return items from multiple active courses.\n      - For the game UX, pick one policy:\n          - A) Mix across all active courses (simpler, but completed becomes ambiguous)\n          - B) Stick to one course at a time (recommended; makes completed meaningful and reduces cognitive switching)\n  - Answered/unseen logic\n      - Yes: selectedAnswer != null in questionItems should be treated as authoritative, because it comes from server progress.\n      - Keep local storage as a fallback for offline/temporary suppression.\n  - Credit endpoint auth\n      - In this repo, /api/student/credit/get is protected by /api/ prefix, so it should use the same Bearer token. (If you’re calling server.eduquest.vip, it should be consistent with the other authenticated\n        endpoints.)\n\n  ## Answers to the open questions\n\n  - Does order equal currentIndex expected by /progress?\n    Not guaranteed. Prefer sending a safe value (0 or a local counter); backend correctness mainly hinges on itemId + selectedAnswer.\n  - What constitutes completed=true?\n    Best treated as “course done”. If your game doesn’t implement course progression, send false always. If you do one-course-at-a-time selection, you can set true when no unseen eligible items remain for that\n    course.\n  - Restrict to one course or mix all questionItems?\n    Recommended: one course at a time (simpler correctness and completion semantics). Mixing is fine if you always send completed=false.\n\n  ## Is the spec ready to implement?\n\n  Yes, with one small decision recorded explicitly:\n\n  - Choose course mixing policy (one-course-at-a-time vs mix), and\n  - Decide how you’ll populate currentIndex and whether you ever set completed=true.\n\n  If you tell me which of those two policies you want (A or B), I can suggest the exact wording to add to the spec for clarity.\n\n\n› Can we choose this : one-course-at-a-time and then can you update your advice\n\n\n• Yes—choosing one-course-at-a-time makes the integration cleaner. Updated guidance:\n\n  - Selection policy\n      - Pick a single courseId as the “current course” (persist it in mod storage).\n      - Only select questions where questionItem.courseId == currentCourseId.\n      - When the current course has no eligible unseen questions left, rotate to the next course (or refetch).\n  - currentIndex\n      - Don’t use order as currentIndex.\n      - Use a simple per-course counter stored locally: currentIndex = attemptsCountForCourse (0,1,2,...). This matches the “resume position” idea without requiring item-order alignment.\n  - completed\n      - Now it has a clear meaning: “this course is done in the game”.\n      - Set completed=true only when there are no remaining eligible unseen questions for that courseId after marking the current one answered.\n      - Otherwise keep completed=false.\n  - Answered/unseen\n      - Still prefer server truth: selectedAnswer != null means answered.\n      - Use local storage as fallback/offline suppression.\n  - Course rotation\n      - If /api/v2/questions/active returns multiple courses, choose the first course that has at least one eligible unseen item and set it as currentCourseId.\n      - If none have unseen, you’re in the “practice wrong” phase (the endpoint will return wrong items when unanswered is empty). You can either:\n          - continue same course and practice wrong, or\n          - declare completion and stop/celebrate.\n\n  If you want, I can also suggest a tiny deterministic course-pick rule (e.g., lowest UUID, or last played) so behavior is stable between sessions.\n\n\n› Yes please :   If you want, I can also suggest a tiny deterministic course-pick rule (e.g., lowest UUID, or last played) so behavior is stable between sessions.\n\n\n• Deterministic “one-course-at-a-time” selection rules that work well:\n\n  ## Recommended rule (stable + user-friendly)\n\n  1. If currentCourseId is saved locally and still appears in data.courses → keep using it.\n  2. Else pick the course with the most eligible unseen questions (computed from questionItems for that course).\n  3. Tie-breaker: pick the course with the most recent updatedAt (if provided), else lowest UUID string.\n\n  This keeps the “current course” sticky, but also ensures you don’t get stuck on a course with no playable questions.\n\n  ## Simpler rule (easy to implement)\n\n  1. If saved currentCourseId still exists → use it.\n  2. Else pick the course with the lowest UUID (string compare).\n  3. If that course has no eligible unseen questions, pick the next lowest, etc.\n\n  ## Persistence keys (suggested)\n\n  - eduquest.current_course_id\n  - eduquest.course_attempt_counter.<courseId> (for currentIndex)\n  - eduquest.answered.<courseId>:<itemId> (local fallback)\n\n  If you want the least moving parts: use the simpler rule. If you want best UX: use the recommended rule.\n\n \n› I like the recommended rule"}
